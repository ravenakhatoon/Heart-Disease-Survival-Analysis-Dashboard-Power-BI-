# Heart-Disease-Survival-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease patient data to understand survival patterns based on age, gender, and clinical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and serum sodium levels. The dashboard is built using Power BI and provides interactive insights to identify high-risk patient groups.

# Objective
Analyze survival and death trends among heart disease patients
Compare survival rates across different age groups and gender
Understand the impact of diabetes and cancer on patient survival

# Tools & Technologies
Power BI
DAX
Microsoft Excel
# Key KPIs
Total Patients
Total Deaths
Total Alive
Alive Percentage
# Dashboard Features
Interactive slicers for Gender and Age Group
KPI cards for quick summary
Age-wise survival analysis
Impact analysis of diabetes and cancer
Clean and user-friendly dark theme design
# Key Insights
Survival rate decreases with increasing age
Patients with diabetes show lower survival rates
Male patients have a higher death count compared to females
Cancer presence negatively impacts survival outcomes
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI and DAX to transform healthcare data into meaningful insights.
The dashboard helps in understanding patient survival trends and supports data-driven decision-making.
